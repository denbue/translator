# Translator

Try here: https://server-translate.wedeploy.io/
The translator is embedded in other applications, hence its missing any kind of independent styling.

This tool translates English input to a number of languages.

1. A node api recieving and processing text
2. A jquery form including config with languages and UX features


Note to myself on how to make changes (you always forget, don't you :):

1. Clone the rep
2. `node install`
3. Make changes
4. Deploy with `we deploy --project translate`
